Notes:

1. Sequences of viruses are not released here and are submitted to [GenBank](GenBank_SRA_submitted.txt).
2. Sample metadata is available through [BioSample](GenBank_SRA_submitted.txt) and more details will be released with the publication in supplementary information.
3. Big files, such as hittables from similarity searches are not released here.
4. Paths to files are often absolute in the scripts here, and are right now replaced with "/full_path_to/wd" or similar.
