[hmmscan to RdRp-scan database](2022_07_21_rdrp_results) was performed by [Frédéric Lemoine](https://github.com/fredericlemoine).

Some followup clade names here were initially given incorrectly and corrected later in the manuscript

| followup_phylo_group_here	| followup_phylo_group_ms_correct |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Negevirus_clade           | Virga-Negev-like_clade          |
| Sobeli_clade	            | Sobemo-Luteo-like_clade         |
| Peribunyaviridae_clade    | Bunyavirales_clade              |
| Caliciviridae_clade       | Polycipiviridae_clade           |
| Negevirus_Tanay_clade     | Negevirus_clade                 |

Some contigs were manually concatenated to form one genome/segment scaffold based on the alignment with the reference. In the scripts and tables I internally referred to them as 'chimeric', although they are actually not chimeric contigs by conventional definition but rather concatenated contigs of the same genome. 

Also some of the ORFs are concatenated for alignment and internally suffixed with 'concat' in the ORF ID
