The initial DIAMOND blastx search was run here. We performed further extraction of best hits from the results, split the results by family/genus/unclassified and further curated the results manually with the help of Geneious and R. However, this was later mostly obsolete when we performed RdRp-scan analysis instead since RdRp-scan recovered all DIAMOND blastx-based hits and more. We only used the results from DIAMOND blastx taxonomic annotation to remove prokaryotic viruses and viruses with RT.
